// Package tools holds the MCP tool handlers. lendora*.go and evm.go carry this
// binary's own surface — the money market plus the EVM landing rail its builds
// settle through; market.go / account.go / trade.go / funds.go / cross.go carry
// the perps families it does not register but keeps (see internal/mcp/doc.go);
// the _v021/_v022 files add later handlers to the same Handlers type.
//
// evmutil.go holds the shared EVM plumbing — eth_call wrappers, token decimals
// and balance reads, the deployment's token registry, the ERC tx assembler —
// which upstream kept inside the swap and ERC tool files that were pruned here.
//
// Each handler:
//  1. Extracts TenantContext from the request context (set by the caller's
//     auth layer — here internal/a2aserver).
//  2. Calls policy.Engine.Check.
//  3. Dispatches to internal/mcp/chain, internal/mcp/indexer, or
//     internal/mcp/builder.
//  4. Maps backend errors to user-visible MCP errors (policy reject →
//     plain text; chain reject → Code + RawLog).
//
// Upstream also carried registry.go, which registered every handler with an
// MCP server via the mcp.AddTool generic and its reflection-derived JSON
// schemas, plus authgate.go for the middleware around it. Neither came across
// in the absorption: this binary serves A2A, and internal/toolbridge binds
// these same handlers to A2A operations instead. Handlers and New live in
// handlers.go.
